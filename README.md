# msgpack-lite [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kawanet/msgpack-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kawanet/msgpack-lite)

Fast Pure JavaScript MessagePack Encoder and Decoder

### Encoding and Decoding

```js
var msgpack = require("msgpack-lite");

// encode from Object to MessagePack (Buffer)
var buffer = msgpack.encode({foo: "bar"});

// decode from MessagePack (Buffer) to Object 
var data = msgpack.decode(buffer); // => {foo: "bar"}
```

### Writing to MessagePack Stream

```js
var fs = require("fs");
var msgpack = require("msgpack-lite");

var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("test.msp");
var encodeStream = msgpack.createEncodeStream();
encodeStream.pipe(writeStream);

// send multiple objects to stream
encodeStream.write({foo: "bar"});
encodeStream.write({baz: "qux"});
```

### Reading from MessagePack Stream

```js
var fs = require("fs");
var msgpack = require("msgpack-lite");

var readStream = fs.createReadStream("test.msp");
var decodeStream = msgpack.createDecodeStream();

// show objects decoded
readStream.pipe(decodeStream).on("data", console.warn);
```

### Command Line Interface

A CLI tool bin/msgpack converts data stream from JSON to MessagePack and vice versa.

```sh
$ echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | ./bin/msgpack -Jm | od -tx1
0000000    81  a3  66  6f  6f  a3  62  61  72

$ echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | ./bin/msgpack -Jm | ./bin/msgpack -Mj
{"foo":"bar"}
```

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save msgpack-lite
```

### Repository

- https://github.com/kawanet/msgpack-lite

### Compatibility

It is tested to have basic compatibility with other MessagePack modules below:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack-js
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack-js-v5
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack5
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack-unpack

The msgpack-lite is the fastest module on both encoding and decoding
operations compared to the other pure JavaScript msgpack-* modules.
Please note that node-gyp backed msgpack module is more fast still, however.
